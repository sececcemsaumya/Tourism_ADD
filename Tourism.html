<h1 class="one" style="color:purple;">Economic Impact</h1>
<h3>Tourism has a substantial economic impact, contributing to revenue generation, job creation, and 
infrastructure development. It boosts local economies by attracting tourists who spend on accommodations, 
food, transportation, and entertainment, thereby increasing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the destination. 
Job opportunities span various sectors, benefiting a diverse workforce. Infrastructure investments improve local 
amenities and connectivity. However, overreliance on tourism, income inequality, environmental degradation, and
 cultural shifts can also occur. Sustainable tourism practices are essential to maximize the positive economic effects 
while minimizing the negative ones, ensuring long-term benefits for both the destination and its residents.</h3><hr>
